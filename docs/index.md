Write the program core, do not bother with the input/output.

![Hello world example: GUI window](asset/hello-world.png "A minimal use case – GUI")
![Hello world example: TUI fallback](asset/hello-tui.webp "A minimal use case – TUI fallback")

Check out the code, which is surprisingly short, that displays such a window or its textual fallback.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from mininterface import run

@dataclass
class Env:
    """Set of options."""

    test: bool = False
    """ My testing flag """

    important_number: int = 4
    """ This number is very important """

if __name__ == "__main__":
    env = run(Env, prog="My application").env
    # Attributes are suggested by the IDE
    # along with the hint text 'This number is very important'.
    print(env.important_number)
```

## You got CLI
It was all the code you need. No lengthy blocks of code imposed by an external dependency. Besides the GUI/TUI, you receive powerful YAML-configurable CLI parsing.

```bash
$ ./hello.py
usage: My application [-h] [--test | --no-test] [--important-number INT]

Set of options.

╭─ options ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ -h, --help              show this help message and exit            │
│ --test, --no-test       My testing flag (default: False)           │
│ --important-number INT  This number is very important (default: 4) │
╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

## You got config file management
Loading config file is a piece of cake. Alongside `program.py`, put `program.yaml` and put there some of the arguments. They are seamlessly taken as defaults.

```yaml
important_number: 555
```

## You got dialogues
Check out several useful methods to handle user dialogues. Here we bound the interface to a `with` statement that redirects stdout directly to the window.

```python
with run(Env) as m:
    print(f"Your important number is {m.env.important_number}")
    boolean = m.is_yes("Is that alright?")
```

# Background

Wrapper between the [tyro](https://github.com/brentyi/tyro) `argparse` replacement and [tkinter_form](https://github.com/JohanEstebanCuervo/tkinter_form/) that converts dicts into a GUI.

Writing a small and useful program might be a task that takes fifteen minutes. Adding a CLI to specify the parameters is not so much overhead. But building a simple GUI around it? HOURS! Hours spent on researching GUI libraries, wondering why the Python desktop app ecosystem lags so far behind the web world. All you need is a few input fields validated through a clickable window... You do not deserve to add hundred of lines of the code just to define some editable fields. `Mininterface` is here to help.

The config variables needed by your program are kept in cozy dataclasses. Write less! The syntax of [tyro](https://github.com/brentyi/tyro) does not require any overhead (as its `argparse` alternatives do). You just annotate a class attribute, append a simple docstring and get a fully functional application:
* Call it as `program.py --help` to display full help.
* Use any flag in CLI: `program.py --test`  causes `env.test` be set to `True`.
* The main benefit: Launch it without parameters as `program.py` to get a full working window with all the flags ready to be edited.
* Running on a remote machine? Automatic regression to the text interface.

# Installation

Install with a single command from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/mininterface/).

```bash
pip install mininterface
```

# Docs
See the docs overview at [https://cz-nic.github.io/mininterface/](https://cz-nic.github.io/mininterface/Overview/).

# Examples

## A complex dataclass.

```python3
from typing import Annotated
from dataclasses import dataclass
from mininterface.validators import not_empty
from mininterface import run, Tag, Validation

@dataclass
class NestedEnv:
  another_number: int = 7
  """ This field is nested """

@dataclass
class Env:
  nested_config: NestedEnv

  mandatory_str: str
  """ As there is not default value, you will be prompted automatically to fill up the field """

  my_number: int | None = None
  """ This is not just a dummy number, if left empty, it is None. """

  my_string: str = "Hello"
  """ A dummy string """

  my_flag: bool = False
  """ Checkbox test """

  my_validated: Annotated[str, Validation(not_empty)] = "hello"
  """ A validated field """

m = run(Env, title="My program")
# See some values
print(m.env.nested_config.another_number)  # 7
print(m.env)
# Env(nested_config=NestedEnv(another_number=7), my_number=5, my_string='Hello', my_flag=False, my_validated='hello')

# Edit values in a dialog
m.form()
```

## Form with paths

We have a dict with some paths. Here is how it looks.

```python
from pathlib import Path
from mininterface import run, Tag

m = run(title="My program")
my_dictionary = {
  "paths": Tag("", annotation=list[Path]),
  "default_paths": Tag([Path("/tmp"), Path("/usr")], annotation=list[Path])
  }

# Edit values in a dialog
m.form(my_dictionary)
```
