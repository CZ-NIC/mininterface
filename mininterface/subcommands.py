    ## SubcommandPlaceholder

    What if I need to use my program
    Special placeholder class SubcommandPlaceholder.
    This special class let the user to choose the subcommands via UI,
    while still benefiniting from default CLI arguments.


    ### The CLI behaviour:
    * `./program.py` -> UI started with subcommand choice
    * `./program.py subcommand --flag` -> special class `SubcommandPlaceholder` allows defining a common `--flag`
        while still starting UI with subcommand choice
    * `./program.py subcommand1 --flag` -> program run
    * `./program.py subcommand1` -> fails to CLI for now


    ## An example of Command usage

    ```python
    from dataclasses import dataclass, field
    from pathlib import Path
    from mininterface import run
    from mininterface.exceptions import ValidationFail
    from mininterface.subcommands import Command, SubcommandPlaceholder
    from tyro.conf import Positional


    @dataclass
    class SharedArgs(Command):
        common: int
        files: Positional[list[Path]] = field(default_factory=list)

        def init(self):
            self.internal = "value"


    @dataclass
    class Subcommand1(SharedArgs):
        my_local: int = 1

        def run(self):
            print("Common:", self.common)  # user input
            print("Number:", self.my_local)  # 1 or user input
            print("Internal:", self.internal)
            raise ValidationFail("The submit button blocked!")


    @dataclass
    class Subcommand2(SharedArgs):
        def run(self):
            self._facet.set_title("Button clicked")  # you can access internal self._facet: Facet
            print("Common files", self.files)


    m = run([Subcommand1, Subcommand2, SubcommandPlaceholder])
    m.alert("App continue")
    ```

    Let's start the program, passing there common flags, all HTML files in a folder and setting `--common` to 7.
    ```bash
    $ program.py  subcommand *.html  --common 7
    ```

    ![Subcommand](asset/subcommands-1.avif)

    As you see, thanks to `SubcommandPlaceholder`, subcommand was not chosen yet. Click to the first button.

    ![Subcommand](asset/subcommands-2.avif)

    and the terminal got:

    ```
    Common: 7
    Number: 1
    Internal: value
    ```

    Click to the second button.

    ![Subcommand](asset/subcommands-3.avif)

    Terminal output:
    ```
    Common files [PosixPath('page1.html'), PosixPath('page2.html')]
    ```

    ### Powerful automation

    Note we use `from tyro.conf import Positional` to denote the positional argument. We did not have to write `--files` to put there HTML files.

    # Why to not document the Subcommand in the Subcommand class itself? It would be output to the user with --help,
